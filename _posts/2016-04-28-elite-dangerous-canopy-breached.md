I enjoy flying spaceships around in Elite Dangerous and this time I was out and about testing my new Diamondback Explorer.
This ship was fitted for combat just like it's predecessor I built, the Diamondback Scout. Cannons and a beam laser with
loads of armor. Unfortunately I didn't realize that due to the Explorers larger size when compared to the Scout it would
more a lot more sluggishly. I was also in the habit of running these things as aggressively as possible and that resulted
in me biting more than I could chew with a Python. Up until this point I always thought that life support was useless so
all I had was 5 minutes of air left... See what happened on the video below.
