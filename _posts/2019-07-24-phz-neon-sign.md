After creating my <a href="/blog/chinese-restaurant-sign">Chinese neon sign render</a> I started thinking if I could
pull this off from scratch using the skills I just learned. An obvious
design was my company's, <a href="https://phz.fi/">PHZ Full Stack</a>, logo.

It was relatively easy and made quick progress. Even modeled chains and mounting points for this one.

Next I learned how to use fSpy to render it onto a wall in an image. This is a picture from a training session
during PHZ Full Stack's summer party. I chose this from our website primarily since it had a good wall it the
background with open space.

Turned out nice in my opinion. I could improve the way the logo and text connecting cabling is routed since
it's kinda messy right now. Also the lights put off by the logo are rendered to a white wall and composited
on the render. Later I realized instead of a white wall I could have used the original image to get the
colors more accurately. But it's fine for now and I'm happy with it.
