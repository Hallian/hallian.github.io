One day on holiday I realized how to create a neon sign in Blender using
bezier curves and I just had to try it out to see if I could pull it off.
I looked online to see some examples of neon signs and found this image
of a Chinese restaurant sign on Google image search. I believe it means
dumplings or something in English. Don't really care, it looks cool.

Here's what I used as a reference.

I think it turned out fine although the neon pipes could be a lot brighter.
